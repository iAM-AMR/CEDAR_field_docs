# CEDAR_field_docs

This is the documentation repository for the [CEDAR web app](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/CEDAR_web). Currently, it contains a set of detailed descriptions of each field within the CEDAR database, organized by table (referred to as *class* in the documentation page itself). It is automatically generated by Django, the web app's framework, as changes are made.

## Update this Repo

1. Copy the *docs* directory of the [CEDAR_web](https://github.com/iAM-AMR/CEDAR_web) repo to this repository after any changes have been made
